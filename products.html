                <h3>Ergon GE1 Evo Grips</h3>
                <p>Leslie has been raving about hers all season, so Dave took them for a test drive. If you haven't been following them on social media, here's the scoop ...</p>

                <h3>Fox Float 32 Factory Step Cast Fork</h3>
                <p>Is it worth it? We are here to help you figure that out. There are things you buy because you can buy them, and things you allocate funds for. Jeremy said he would plan an entire bike build around this suspension fork, he loves it that much. Dave said he'd pass. Why two different takes from two such well respected riders? Obviously it comes down to the investment and the return. What are you looking to get out of your bike?</p>

                <p>Our 1st Summer Slalom is coming up. It's not your typical winter slalom, with straight downhill and cones. But there is a lot of downhill, and there are a *lot* of trees to navigate. So now is the time to start re-evaluating those old tires you are rolling on.</p>
                <p>We are big fans of these. The price point is reasonable, especially for a product you replace pretty regularly, and the control on unsteady terrain is much better than we expected.</p>
                <p>If you want to see them in action, visit us at the shop. Dave will let you race around on his in the gravel lot behind the store.</p>

                <h3>SRAM GX Eagle Drivetrain</h3>
                <p>Is it better than Shimano? That's a loaded question, but if you want to come check it out in action, come down to the store for a demo.</p>
